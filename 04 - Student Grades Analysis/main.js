     04 - Student Grades Analysis
 -----------------------------------

 Objective: In this exercise, students will create a program that analyzes student grades, determines the highest and lowest grades, and calculates the average grade

1. Create an array that holds 8 grades (integers between 0 and 100) representing the scores of different students - level 1: TJEK
2. Log out how many grades there are - level 1: TJEK
3. Classify and log each grade into one of the following categories - level 2: TJEK
4. Evaluate overall class performance - level 2
5. Optional - Determine - level 3
6. Output:
    The highest grade with its category.
    The lowest grade with its category.
    The average grade.
    A list of all grades with their corresponding categories.
